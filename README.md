# Course title: Digital Literacy & English Education

## Course Overview

This course is designed for in-service English teachers and focuses on how digital and AI literacy can support English teaching in rapidly changing educational environments. Rather than approaching technology as an external addition, the course frames digital and AI literacy as essential components of contemporary English education, shaping how language is taught, learned, and evaluated.

In today’s classrooms, English learning is increasingly mediated through digital platforms, online tools, and AI-driven systems. Language activities are designed, delivered, and assessed within environments influenced by algorithms and intelligent technologies. As a result, English teachers are required to understand not only how to use digital tools, but also how these tools affect classroom interaction, learning processes, and professional decision-making. This course addresses these challenges by situating digital and AI literacy within the everyday practices of English education.

Throughout the semester, the course adopts a project-based learning (PBL) approach. Participants work collaboratively in small groups to design and develop simple web-based applications for specific English teaching purposes. Through hands-on engagement with coding, app development, and digital tool design, participants explore how digital environments can support learner engagement and the creation of instructional materials.

Rather than prescribing specific pedagogical methods, the course draws on participants’ own teaching experience as a central resource. Technical activities serve as opportunities for reflection on instructional design, language use, and professional agency in digital contexts. Ultimately, the course aims to support English teachers in responding thoughtfully and flexibly to ongoing educational change in the digital and AI era.

# Course Rationale  
*(For Special Lectures and Program Proposals)*

This course responds to the growing need for **digital and AI literacy within English education**. As language teaching increasingly takes place in digitally mediated environments, English teachers are required to engage with platforms, tools, and intelligent systems that shape how language is taught, learned, and assessed.

Rather than treating technology as an add-on or optional skill set, this course positions **digital and AI literacy as integral to contemporary English teaching practice**. The focus is not on mastering specific tools, but on developing the capacity to understand, evaluate, and adapt to changing educational environments. Coding and app development are introduced as practical means for examining how digital tools influence learner interaction, instructional materials, and classroom decision-making.

The course adopts a **project-based learning (PBL)** approach, encouraging participants to collaborate on the design of web-based applications for specific English teaching purposes. These projects function as shared reference points for discussion and reflection, drawing on participants’ own teaching experience. By fostering a common level of digital understanding among educators, the course aims to support meaningful dialogue, collaboration, and innovation in English education in the digital and AI era.


# 강의 개요 (국문 요약)

## 디지털·AI 리터러시와 응용언어학  
*(Digital & AI Literacy in Applied Linguistics)*

본 강의는 **현직 영어교사(in-service English teachers)**를 대상으로, **응용언어학(applied linguistics)**을 현대 교육 환경에 맞게 확장하여 이해하는 것을 목표로 한다. 응용언어학은 전통적으로 교육 및 사회 맥락에서의 언어 문제를 다루어 왔으나, 최근에는 **디지털 기술(digital technologies)**과 **인공지능(AI)**이 언어 사용과 상호작용, 그리고 교사의 전문적 실천을 어떻게 매개하는지에 대한 논의로 영역을 확장하고 있다.

오늘날 교육 환경에서 언어는 플랫폼(platforms), 알고리즘(algorithms), 지능형 시스템(intelligent systems)을 통해 생산되고 평가된다. 이러한 변화 속에서 **디지털 리터러시(digital literacy)**와 **AI 리터러시(AI literacy)**는 언어 교사에게 필수적인 전문 역량으로 자리 잡고 있다. 본 강의는 디지털 및 AI 리터러시를 기술 훈련이 아닌, 영어교육 맥락의 변화를 이해하기 위한 응용언어학적 관점으로 다룬다.

강의 전반에 걸쳐 **프로젝트 기반 학습(Project-Based Learning, PBL)**이 적용되며, 수강생들은 소그룹으로 협력하여 **언어 교수 목적에 맞는 간단한 웹 기반 애플리케이션(web-based applications)**을 설계하고 제작한다. 코딩(coding)과 앱 개발(app development) 활동은 학습자 참여, 수업 자료 설계, 교사의 전문적 의사결정이 디지털 환경에서 어떻게 이루어지는지를 탐구하는 수단으로 활용된다.

본 강의는 특정 교수법을 일방적으로 제시하기보다는, 수강생 각자의 교육 경험을 토대로 디지털 및 AI 환경 변화에 어떻게 대응할 수 있을지를 함께 논의하고 성찰하는 데 중점을 둔다. 이를 통해 영어교사가 급변하는 교육 환경 속에서 전문적 판단과 실천을 확장할 수 있도록 돕는 것을 목표로 한다.
