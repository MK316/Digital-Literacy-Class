# Course title: Digital Literacy & English Education

## Course Overview

This course is designed for in-service English teachers and focuses on how digital and AI literacy can support English teaching in rapidly changing educational environments. Rather than approaching technology as an external addition, the course frames digital and AI literacy as essential components of contemporary English education, shaping how language is taught, learned, and evaluated.

In today’s classrooms, English learning is increasingly mediated through digital platforms, online tools, and AI-driven systems. Language activities are designed, delivered, and assessed within environments influenced by algorithms and intelligent technologies. As a result, English teachers are required to understand not only how to use digital tools, but also how these tools affect classroom interaction, learning processes, and professional decision-making. This course addresses these challenges by situating digital and AI literacy within the everyday practices of English education.

Throughout the semester, the course adopts a project-based learning (PBL) approach. Participants work collaboratively in small groups to design and develop simple web-based applications for specific English teaching purposes. Through hands-on engagement with coding, app development, and digital tool design, participants explore how digital environments can support learner engagement and the creation of instructional materials.

Rather than prescribing specific pedagogical methods, the course draws on participants’ own teaching experience as a central resource. Technical activities serve as opportunities for reflection on instructional design, language use, and professional agency in digital contexts. Ultimately, the course aims to support English teachers in responding thoughtfully and flexibly to ongoing educational change in the digital and AI era.

# Course Rationale  

This course responds to the growing need for **digital and AI literacy within English education**. As language teaching increasingly takes place in digitally mediated environments, English teachers are required to engage with platforms, tools, and intelligent systems that shape how language is taught, learned, and assessed.

Rather than treating technology as an add-on or optional skill set, this course positions **digital and AI literacy as integral to contemporary English teaching practice**. The focus is not on mastering specific tools, but on developing the capacity to understand, evaluate, and adapt to changing educational environments. Coding and app development are introduced as practical means for examining how digital tools influence learner interaction, instructional materials, and classroom decision-making.

The course adopts a **project-based learning (PBL)** approach, encouraging participants to collaborate on the design of web-based applications for specific English teaching purposes. These projects function as shared reference points for discussion and reflection, drawing on participants’ own teaching experience. By fostering a common level of digital understanding among educators, the course aims to support meaningful dialogue, collaboration, and innovation in English education in the digital and AI era.
