+ The organization of the presentation was good and the examples of how it can be used in education was also meaningful. Typing out subtitles by hand may hard to students and take
+ Students get to hear how phrases are used in real-life contexts with natural pronunciation, intonation, and emotion. This bridges the gap between textbook English and real-world English. Also, The role play element pushes students to use the expressions creatively, which helps with long-term retention and builds confidence. But some of the clips on playphrase.me may include fast, unclear, or idiomatic language that is difficult for middle school students to understand without support. Since the clips are from various movies or TV shows, some content may not be age-appropriate or relevant for younger students. Teachers may need to pre-screen or carefully guide the search process.
+ The narrative format can enhance retention by making language input more memorable and emotionally engaging. However, It might take more time to apply in a regular classroom.
+ One of the advantages is that students can be provided various examples of expressions in a textbook. One of the disadvantages is that if students have bad internet connection, they will have difficulty using the tool.

+ summarizing of the benefits of ZEP was good. I would have liked to see more step-by-step instructions on how to prepare for class.
+ Informative and suitable for classroom instruction.
+ It was easy to understand the digital tool that introduced by directly presenting examples of digital tools to be used in video. However, it was unfortunate because it felt like the presenters were only talking about the advantages of ZEP in the part of the target learners.
+ It was impressive to show the actual use and explain the digital tool. However, the speed of tts was so fast that I had difficulty understanding the presentation right away.

+ The variety of quiz types, conversation simulations with AI, and use of native speaker videos make Memrise feel dynamic and engaging. And they clearly highlight how the reward system helps with learner motivation and consistency, which is a major plus for language acquisition. But since Memrise is primarily designed for self-paced learning, it might be challenging to integrate into a classroom where students progress at different speeds. Teachers would need to create structured plans to align it with lessons. Also, teachers may not be able to easily track studentsâ€™ individual progress or customize the content in Memrise to match specific classroom goals unless they use additional tools outside the app.
+ If executed properly according to the instructions, it seems like it would be suitable for students to use.
+ They showed how to use the app very clearly. However, teachers may find it hard to align Memrise content exactly with their own lesson goals or curriculum.
+ It was easy to understand the digital tool that introduced by directly presenting examples of digital tools to be used in video. However, it was unfortunate because it felt like the presenters were only talking about the advantages of ZEP in the part of the target learners.
+ WIth Memrise, you can use all those vocabulary quizzes, AI conversation practice, and native speakers' videos to reinforce your English skills, especially on words. Because it gives the user rewards after each sessions, it can make learners keep interested in the content. However, I personally worried about the point that AI conversation may not perfect. Though AI learns how we, real human beings, communicate with each other using a language, we use much more abbreviated expressions or internet-memes online, which makes the data imperfect.
+ It might be useful to study by oneself, but I think we have to find the way we can wisely use this app in classroom.
+ One of the advantages is that the app can provide personalization language teaching by AI. One of the disadvantages is that students can not interact each other by using its functions.
