        (Note: If you want, you can download Python to install on your computer and use an IDE for coding. However, we'll use Google colab, clouding-based Python platform without installing the program directly for our class purposes.)
        
        **Download Python** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
        **Use an IDE (Integrated Development Environment)** like VS Code or PyCharm.  

        Follow the steps below to start:
        
        1️⃣ **Visiti [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) and log in with your Google account**   
        2️⃣ **Start with basic commands** like printing messages and performing calculations.  
        3️⃣ **Practice regularly** with small projects and exercises.
