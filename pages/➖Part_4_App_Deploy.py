st.caption("Deploying an app means making it available for others to use online. After writing and testing your code, you can host your app on a platform like Streamlit Cloud, Hugging Face Spaces, or GitHub Pages. These platforms take care of the setup, so you don't need advanced server knowledge. For beginners, Streamlit is a great choice because it allows you to deploy a Python app with just a few clicks. You upload your code to GitHub, connect it to Streamlit Cloud, and your app goes live with a shareable link. This makes it easy to create and share interactive applications without complex configurations.")
